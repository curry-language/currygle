Curr(y)gle
==========

Curr(y)gle is a search engine for the functional logic
programming language [Curry](https://curry-lang.org/).
It is intended to find entities (modules, functions, types, classes, and
signatures) defined in modules of
[published Curry packages](https://cpm.curry-lang.org/).
Additionally, Curr(y)gle searches in description and author
information.
One can also restrict the search restrictions to non-deterministic or
deterministic as well as rigid or flexible operations.

Installation
------------

Since Curry(g)le is written in Curry, the installation requires
a Curry implementation. Since the size of the processed data
is big, it is recommended to use [KiCS2](https://www.curry-lang.org/kics2/)
or another efficient Curry implementation.

To install Curr(y)gle from this repository,
check and adapt the variable definitions in the Makefile
(in particular, `CURRYHOME`, `WEBDIR`, and `CDOC`) and run

    > make install
    > make deploy

to install all executables in the directory `WEBDIR`.


Usage
-----

After the sucessful installation, go into the directory `WEBDIR`.
Fill the directory `CDOC` with the `.cdoc` files from the documentation
of all Curry packages (which are generated by the CurryDoc documentation
generator when packages are uploaded).
This directory contains for each package (where only the newest version
should be stored) a subdirectory named with the package version identifier.
For instance, the `.cdoc` files of the documentation of package
`base` version `3.3.0` must be stored in the subdirectory `CDOC/base-3.3.0`.
When this directory contains all relevant data, run

    > make index

to generate the index files used by Curry(g)le.
Then one can test Curry(g)le in a terminal mode by

    > bin/currygle --interactive

Since the index files are too large to read them for every search request
in the web interface (reading the index files takes a couple of seconds),
one can start the Curr(y)gle server by

    > make start

This will also be done by the web interface if the server is not reachable.
Then one can use the web interface by referring to the URL of the
`WEBDIR` directory in a browser. There is also a ready-to-use
[installation of Curr(y)gle](https://cpm.curry-lang.org/currygle/)
in the [Curry home page](https://www.curry-lang.org).
The possible search queries are described in the initial default page
of Curr(y)gle.
